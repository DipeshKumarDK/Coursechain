        The best way to improve and save time is to ask questions. Our new
        (DALL-E Generator in React) now has access to limited free mentorship at
        the newly launched Code With AI program you can check out directly here:
        https://codewithai.org You can ask a couple questions for free regarding
        all things JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java, C++ (Smart Contracts, React,
        frontend and backend etc) and much much more. You get a compiler,
        console, and text editor that you can test out your code and practice
        with. Once you've reached your limit of free interactions, share what
        you've learned with our community and keep on practicing. Best of luck
        on your journey ahead!
