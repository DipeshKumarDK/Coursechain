          Planning your course carefully will create a clear learning path for
          students and help you once you film. Think down to the details of each
          lecture including the skill you’ll teach, estimated video length,
          practical activities to include, and how you’ll create introductions
          and summaries.

          Setting goals for what learners will accomplish in your course (also
          known as learning objectives) at the beginning will help you determine
          what content to include in your course and how you will teach the
          content to help your learners achieve the goals.

        <h4 className="text-slate-300 text-[0.9rem] mt-[5px] lg:w-4/5 w-full">
          Decide what skills you’ll teach and how you’ll teach them. Group
          related lectures into sections. Each section should have at least 3
          lectures, and include at least one assignment or practical activity.

          Introduce yourself and create momentum.

        <h4 className="text-slate-300 text-[0.9rem] mt-[5px] lg:w-4/5 w-full">
          People online want to start learning quickly. Make an introduction
          section that gives learners something to be excited about in the first
          10 minutes.

          Sections have a clear learning objective.
        </h3>
        <h4 className="text-slate-300 text-[0.9rem] mt-[5px] lg:w-4/5 w-full">
          Introduce each section by describing the section's goal and why it’s
          important. Give lectures and sections titles that reflect their
          content and have a logical flow.

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-8">Lectures cover one concept.</h3>
        <h4 className="text-slate-300 text-[0.9rem] mt-[5px] lg:w-4/5 w-full">
          A good lecture length is 2-7 minutes to keep students interested and
          help them study in short bursts. Cover a single topic in each lecture
          so learners can easily find and re-watch them later.
